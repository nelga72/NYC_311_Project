### Introduction
This project was completed in May, 2018 for a class in Python programming for GIS applications. 
It is fully reproducible from data import to visualization, creating a final shapefile output with all variables.
  
### Requirements  
To geocode, a Google API key needs to be acquired and saved in a `.txt` file.  

### Installations  
The libraries used are all built in to the Anaconda package, with the exception of `GeoPandas`.
See [documentation](http://geopandas.org/install.html) for dependencies and instructions to install.
