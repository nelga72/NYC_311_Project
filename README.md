## Unlikely Characteristics of NYC
----
### Introduction
This project was completed in May, 2018 for a class in Python programming for GIS applications. 
It is fully reproducible from data import to visualization, creating a final shapefile output with all variables.
  
### Requirements  
To geocode, a Google API key needs to be acquired and saved in a `.txt` file. A selection of 311 service call data were obtained for each variable as a `.csv` file available from [NYC OpenData](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) on April 22nd, 2018. To re-do this project with up-to-date versions of this data, change the file path of 311 variables in the script to open the newly downloaded `.csv`. 

### Installations  
The libraries used are all built in to the Anaconda package, with the exception of `GeoPandas`.
See [documentation](http://geopandas.org/install.html) for dependencies and instructions to install.
